Notes about the examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Pixy and Weverca fails on the ECOOP "onetwo VS twotwo" examples (1-2-3) giving both 
  false positives and negatives (couldn't test PHANTM). 
  Surprisingly, however, RIPS runs them correclty! No false positives/negatives.
  It seems that RIPS model execution order well. 

- raphael-xss.php: it seems that RIPS is weak on type conversions. 
  When $x is tainted, it raises an error even for $x + 1. 
  All other tools instead don't raise an error for that. 

- daniele-xss.php: it uses aliasing between array elements. Pixy and Weverca 
  find the XSS but not RIPS. This also suggests it is weak w.r.t. aliasing.
