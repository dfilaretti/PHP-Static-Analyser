Notes about the examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Pixy and Weverca fails on the ECOOP "onetwo VS twotwo" examples (1-2-3) giving both 
  false positives and negatives (couldn't test PHANTM). 
  Surprisingly, however, RIPS runs them correclty! No false positives/negatives.
  It seems that RIPS model execution order well. 

- raphael-xss.php: it seems that RIPS is weak on type conversions. 
  When $x is tainted, it raises an error even for $x + 1. 
  All other tools instead don't raise an error for that. 

- daniele-xss.php: it uses aliasing between array elements. Pixy and Weverca 
  find the XSS but not RIPS. This also suggests it is weak w.r.t. aliasing.

- break: none of the tools I tried misses vulnerabilities in my simple examples. 
  However, we are more precise then Pixy and RIPS.

- recursion: Pixy and RIPS report errors even when a (vuln) function is not called

- weird: look at 'recursion-def-only-false-alarms'. Vuln function not called. 
  If XSS is inside IF pixy report no false alarm. 
  If it is not (but still inside function body) then it does 

- pass by reference: seems to be only supported by Weverca

- crazy-1.php and crazy-2.php : tried some function as Sergio suggested.. doing
  some weird variable function call using array elements as params + alias etc.
  Pixy doesn't even try. Weverca seems to SPOT the errors. Notice however that in
  one of the examples (the most complex) it says "Couldn't resolve all 
  possible calls". 
  RIPS doesn't say anything for the simpler example, but gives a warnign in the 
  most complex. It doesn't find XSS but complains that user-data is used
  as a function name. 

- having trouble tricking Weverca

- weverca: it seems a bit "brute force" but after a constant it gives up. 
  for example, I tried, a recursive call. I got 5 warnings then it stopped. 
  Can we exploit this? 

- possible ways to trick weverca: 
	* check for constants after which it gives up (see above) 
	* $_GET/etc. used as variable variables:

		function foo() {
			if (?) 
 				$k = "_GET"
			else
				$k = "foo"

			echo $k["bar"];
		}

- Superglobals cannot be used as variable variables: weverca reports a false alarm
  (Pixy and RIPS doesn't issue any error, but they don't even support variable variables I guess)
