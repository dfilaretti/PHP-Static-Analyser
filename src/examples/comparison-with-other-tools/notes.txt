Notes about the examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Pixy and Weverca fails on the ECOOP "onetwo VS twotwo" examples (1-2-3) giving both 
  false positives and negatives (couldn't test PHANTM). 
  Surprisingly, however, RIPS runs them correclty! No false positives/negatives.
  It seems that RIPS model execution order well. 

- raphael-xss.php: it seems that RIPS is weak on type conversions. 
  When $x is tainted, it raises an error even for $x + 1. 
  All other tools instead don't raise an error for that. 

- daniele-xss.php: it uses aliasing between array elements. Pixy and Weverca 
  find the XSS but not RIPS. This also suggests it is weak w.r.t. aliasing.

- break: none of the tools I tried misses vulnerabilities in my simple examples. 
  However, we are more precise then Pixy and RIPS.

- recursion: Pixy and RIPS report errors even when a (vuln) function is not called

- weird: look at 'recursion-def-only-false-alarms'. Vuln function not called. 
  If XSS is inside IF pixy report no false alarm. 
  If it is not (but still inside function body) then it does 

- pass by reference: seems to be only supported by Weverca
